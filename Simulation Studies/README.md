# Simulation Studies

Each folder contains `setup.R` and `run.R` to execute a single simulation under different scenarios. One can replicate the simulation results by running each simulation with seeds from 1 to 5000.

- [DGPomtm1](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/ordinal_clovers/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies/DGPomtm1) contains the code used to generate the results for Tables 3-4 and Figure 2. It generates data under the OMTM1 process and implements 13 estimation procedures to calculate the odds ratio (Table 3) and the risk difference (Table 4) across the complete follow-up, DAR (mild), and DAR (severe) scenarios.
- [DGPsurvival](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/ordinal_clovers/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies/DGPsurvival) contains the code used to generate the results for Table 4. It generates data under the Survival process and implements 4 estimation procedures (GLMB, BMTM, BMTM-C, and Survival) with binary outcome to calculate the risk difference (Table 4) across the complete follow-up, DAR (mild), and DAR (severe) scenarios.
- [Misspecification](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/ordinal_clovers/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies/Misspecification) contains the code used to generate the results for Table 5. It generates 1) data under the OMTM3 (misspecification of $\beta_{xt}$) and 2) OMTM1 data that relaxes the PO assumption on T and Z (misspecification of $\beta_{z}$). Following each data generating process, it implements 12 estimation procedures to calculate the odds ratio under the complete follow-up scenario.
- [Nonabsorbing](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/ordinal_clovers/tree/main/Simulation%20Studies/Nonabsorbing) contains the code used to generate the results for Table A1. It generates data under the OMTM1 using the dependence model parameter matrix with a non-absorbing state and implements 12 estimation procedures to calculate the odds ratio under the complete follow-up scenario.
